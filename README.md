# My Rest API
A version of a REST API - Applying my training

This API is made to get the ninjas around an area that the user specifies. Initialy, through Node.js and Express the server has been configured.

Then, the database with MongoDB is set to get the available ninjas. The Post, Put and Delete requests are tested with postman.

Finally, by creating a React component (Frontend), the user can operate the API. By typing some coordinates, the app will give the ninjas arround and their availibity.

### Made with..

- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- The Post, Put and Delete methods are tested in postman
- React (Component for user Frontend)
- Run with "nodemon index"
- For the browser: localhost.
- Test it by typing the coordinates 24.8 (Latitude) and -80.5 (Longitude)
